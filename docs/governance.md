# Governance
The society is led by *The Pedro*, who is responsible for curating the relevant topics (which, despite so far being solely mathematics - as Hume taught us - does not mean this is a maths soc). The Pedro is supported by other members.

This soc does not work on a democratic basis, since we believe one's capacity to benefit the people in this society is more important than one's popularity. Therefore, all the positions of this society work on indication basis, *including the position of Pedro*.

We thank the following people for running the society:

- [Pedro de Oliveira Lengruber Lack](mailto:pedro.lack@univ.ox.ac.uk) (The First Pedro)
- Sidharth Suresh (The Bureaucracy Guy)
- Shing Fung Lau (The Notes Guy)
- Morgan Healey (Freshers' Officer)
- [Samuel Chun Hei Lam](https://wcr.univ.ox.ac.uk/profile/Samuel-CHLam) (The WCR Guy)
