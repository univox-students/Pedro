# Governance
The society is led by *The Pedro*, who is responsible for curating the relevant topics (which, despite so far being solely mathematics - as Hume taught us - does not mean this is a maths soc). The Pedro is supported by other members.

We thank the following people for running the society:

- [Pedro de Oliveira Lengruber Lack](mailto:pedro.lack@univ.ox.ac.uk) (The First Pedro)
- Sidharth Suresh (The Bureaucracy Guy)
- Shing Fung Lau (The Notes Guy)
- Morgan Healey (Freshers' Officer)
- [Samuel Chun Hei Lam](https://wcr.univ.ox.ac.uk/profile/Samuel-CHLam) (The WCR Guy)
