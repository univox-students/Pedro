### 03/06/2024 (Week 3) - Law of Iterated Logarithm I: demytifying almost sure convergence
*Speaker: Samuel Chun Hei Lam*

In the sequel of two talks we shall understand and proof the classical result of [law of iterated logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_iterated_logarithm) in probability theory. For this talk we shall understand what it meant for an event to happen *almost surely*, and develop the tool of [Chernoff bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_bound) (a stronger notion of convergence in probability) to establish almost sure convergence of a properly scaled standard random walk.


### 21/10/2024 (Week 2) - Sieve Theory
*Speaker: Gareth*

We will look at how we could carefully design the sieves of natural numbers (the famous one being the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)) to give an upper bound of the number of prime numbers that satisfies certain properties. You will be surprised that a little trick would be the foundations of reasonably strong results to a handful of famous problems in analytic number theory.


### 14/10/2024 (Week 1) - Bertrand's Postulate
*Speaker: D. Pedro Lack*

We shall go through the [Ramanujan's](http://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram24.pdf) and [Erd≈ë's proof](https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/pdf/bertrand.pdf) of the [Bertrand's Postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate), which states that for any integers m, there exists prime number such that m/2 < p < m-1. This is a good starting point if you want to have a feeling on what analytic number theory is about.
