## 2025 Hilary Term

### 03/02/2025 (Week 4) - Riesz-Markov Representation Theorem
*Speaker: Shing Fung Chan*

We shall prove the Riesz-Markov Representation Theorem, which states that any functional of the space of continuous, compactly supported function are Lebesgue Integrals. This shall motivate another way of defining the Lebesgue Integral.


### 03/02/2025 (Week 3) - Lebesgue Measures and Integrals
*Speaker: Shing Fung Chan*

We will go through the standard way to construct *the Lebesgue measure* and *Lebesgue integral* on the real line, and why are these constructions are the better ones.


### 27/01/2025 (Week 2) - Algebraic Topology
*Speaker: Morgan Healey*

In this talk we will be motivating a special class of topological groups. Our canonical example will be the p-adic integers, but we will see many more and understand how they connect to the theory of finite groups. We will also see the importance of topology in number theory and algebraic geometry. Finally we will touch on cohomology and the usefulness of category theory in maths.


### 20/01/2025 (Week 1) - Fermat Last Theorem for Polynomials
*Speaker: Pedro Lack*

We shall start the year by proving the Fermat's last theorem (for polynomials)! It is very exciting, still should be quite easy to follow (no prerequisites)!

## 2024 Michaelmas Term

### 25/11/2024 (Week 8) - 8 &#10178; &#8734: How to become JCR President: what deep data analysis on democracies can say about College politics?"
*Speaker: Ardeel Hussain*

Given that we are not a maths society, but rather a Pedro society, the Pedro was happy to announce the project 8 &#10178; &#8734, in which PedroSoc always reserves week 8 to topics perpendicular to the infinite (that is earthly and material topics). In order to inaugurate this project, I am happy to announce that Ardeel Hussain will be our guest speaker and he will present on the topic: "How to become JCR president: what deep data analysis on democracies can say about College politics". As usual, we are meeting on Monday at 7 in 90 High Street! I am waiting for all of you!


### 25/11/2024 (Week 7) - Hasse Theorem II
*Speaker: Pedro Lack*

We shall go further and prove if a quadratic Diophantine equation has a solution in the ring of polynomials. This relies on the notion of *Hilbert Symbol* and results of quadratic reciprocity.

### 18/11/2024 (Week 6) - Hasse Theorem I: what does it feel like to invent mathematics?
*Speaker: Pedro Lack*

We know how check if a linear Diophantine equation for integers has  solution. Can we do more? We will start by *creating* the p-adic numbers, before proving a version of the Hasse Theorem that determines if linear Diophantine equation has a solution in the ring of polynomials.

### 11/11/2024 (Week 5) - Permutation and Primes
*Speaker: Yifu Zhang*

We shall explore a surprising connection between permutation and primes. A highlight is the shockingly similar Central Limit Theorems of primes (Erdos-Kac) and permutations (permutations).

### 04/11/2024 (Week 4) - Law of Iterated Logarithm Part II
*Speaker: Samuel Chun Hei Lam*

With the tools built from the previous talk, we shall now complete the proof of the classical *law of iterated logarithms*. We shall see how the Borel-Cantelli lemma and the Chernoff bound give half of the proof. Then we will do a little bit more heavy-lifting to obtain the second half of the proof (which may also lead to the Central Limit Theorem for free).


### 03/06/2024 (Week 3) - Law of Iterated Logarithm I: demytifying almost sure convergence
*Speaker: Samuel Chun Hei Lam*

In the sequel of two talks we shall understand and proof the classical result of [law of iterated logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_iterated_logarithm) in probability theory. For this talk we shall understand what it meant for an event to happen *almost surely*, and develop the tool of [Chernoff bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_bound) (a stronger notion of convergence in probability) to establish almost sure convergence of a properly scaled standard random walk.


### 21/10/2024 (Week 2) - Sieve Theory
*Speaker: Gareth*

We will look at how we could carefully design the sieves of natural numbers (the famous one being the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)) to give an upper bound of the number of prime numbers that satisfies certain properties. You will be surprised that a little trick would be the foundations of reasonably strong results to a handful of famous problems in analytic number theory.


### 14/10/2024 (Week 1) - Bertrand's Postulate
*Speaker: Pedro Lack*

We shall go through the [Ramanujan's](http://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram24.pdf) and [Erd≈ë's proof](https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/pdf/bertrand.pdf) of the [Bertrand's Postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate), which states that for any integers m, there exists prime number such that m/2 < p < m-1. This is a good starting point if you want to have a feeling on what analytic number theory is about.
