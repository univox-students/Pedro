## 2025 Michaelmas Term

### 17/02/2025 (Week 5) - Five mini talks
Do you desire to give a talk in PedroSoc, but you can't put together a full 1h30 talk? Do you want to test your skills, giving a shorter talk? PedroSoc has a new project: week 5 talks! We will try to get 5 mini-talks (between 15 and 30 minutes) in one meeting! Hoping to see many of your submissions! Any ideas (not necessarily maths) invited!

| Speaker | Content |
| :-- | :-- |
| Inha Choi | **The Structure of Paradox** <br/> I shall present the various ways of paradox, their resolution, and their implications. |
| Edison Fu | **Axiomatic Special Relativity** <br/> What have you heard about special relativity? Spacetime is funny, sometimes time dilates and length contracts? This is boring stuff--In this talk, I will be proving all these classic results from Einstein's original two postulates. I will also be discussing the importance (and sheer beauty!) of symmetries in the geometry of spacetime, and how they clear up loose ends left by classical physics. |
| Jonathan Sakunkoo | **Area of Lattice Polygon** <br/> Have you ever doodled on graph paper? Connected the dots in some way, ended up with something interesting - perhaps something more complex, like your favorite cartoon character, or perhaps something simpler, like a smiley face? Perhaps you may even have wondered about such a geometric figure's area... (or maybe not, but come to my talk to find out anyways) Come to my talk to find out about an outrageously beautiful and simple formula that (arguably) trumps the others methods...! It'll be very accessible, that is, you'll understand :3 |
| Tom Davies | **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions** <br/> Trigonometric functions are remarkable and versatile mathematical objects which show up everywhere. What has often interested me are the two, quite distinct approaches that one can take to discovering, (informally) defining and developing them: the geometric and analytic approaches. I will offer a (new?) way of linking these approaches which will (I hope) be intuitive and beautiful. I will also discuss generalisations, in particular hyperbolic functions. Please do come along if this sounds interesting! |
| Rico Chung | **Mysteries of the Cantor set** <br/> What does it mean for a set to take up space, or even more strangely, to take up no space at all? In this talk, I’ll give an introduction to measure theory and explore a fascinating set in analysis: the Cantor set. We will see that rearranging bits of “dust” can transform something that occupies no space into something that does and many other fascinating results. Join me as we uncover the surprising and beautiful properties of this mind-bending set, no prerequisites required! |

### 03/02/2025 (Week 4) - Motivating Neural Networks
*Speaker: Samuel Lam*

We shall motivate the concept of neural networks by piecewise linear functions, which is a class of neural networks and solves a non-parametric regression problem. If time allows, we will explain why *depth* matters for neural network.

### 03/02/2025 (Week 3) - All about Blackjack
*Speaker: Anthony Hu*

Feeling lucky? Tonight is all about Blackjack, a classic casino game for all ages (18 and over). We’ll be briefly outlining the rich history of the game, before exploring how to optimize play. However, unlike most Monte Carlo approaches, we’ll attempt to use analytical solutions to derive solutions from first principles. The maths should be very accessible to all attendees. So sit back, relax, sip on a virgin martini (that I’ll make), and enjoy the show!

*And feel free to come in suit and tie, but of course that’s entirely optional.*

### 27/01/2025 (Week 2) - Mathematigician Clinics
*Speaker: Yifu Zhang*

Be prepared for a magic show, or I guess a mathemagic show. Unlike magicians, mathemagicians always reveal their secrets, and tonight, we are spoiled with a great one. Yifu (our resident mathemagicians) will be performing magic tricks in PedroSoc tonight at 7h30 (meet in Lodge). The talk is accessible for everyone (even those with no background in mathematics or mathemagics), and no matter who you are, I am sure you will leave with a cool magic trick to impress your friends.


### 20/01/2025 (Week 1) - Irrational Numbers
*Speaker: Pedro Lack*

We shall start the year by proving the Fermat's last theorem (for polynomials)! It is very exciting, still should be quite easy to follow (no prerequisites)!
