> **[Check out our appearance at the Oxford Students.](https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2025/05/02/pedrosoc-embracing-erudition/) Thanks Yuhan Wang for writing this article.**

*By the grace of the Pedro*, PedroSoc is set up as the University College seminar on undergraduate-level extra-curricular academic topics from all disciplines!

We meet at the following time and venue:

- Date: every Monday
- Time: from 7.30pm, until *we forget how to multiply*.
- Venue: Meeting Room 2, 12 Merton Street, University College. 

Whilst this is a Univ society, we welcome attendance and contributions from other members and alumni of the Oxford University. If you wish to join our community (aka our WhatsApp chat), [please contact any one of the committees below](#committee)! 

The seminar series is named after Pedro Lack, the founder (founding *Pedro*) of this seminar series. 

## Upcoming Talks (Michaelmas 2025)

### 17/11/2025 (Week 6) - The Aliens Trick
*Speaker: Çağan Yanmaz*

This talk explores a fascinating connection between a modern algorithmic technique and a classical concept from mathematics: the use of Lagrange multipliers. The technique, known as the Aliens Trick, was originally discovered in the context of the IOI 2016 problem Aliens and has since become a powerful optimisation method in Dynamic Programming.

I will begin with a gentle introduction to Competitive Programming and the role of Dynamic Programming in algorithm design. Then, I’ll explain how the Aliens Trick works, why it’s effective, and how it reveals links between different ways to solve optimisation problems. If time allows, I’ll demonstrate the full solution to the Aliens problem and show how similar ideas appear in other contexts.

The talk will be self-contained and accessible to all; a solid mathematical background will be helpful, but no prior knowledge of Computer Science is required.

## Want to give a talk?
You can submit a talk by [filling this form](https://forms.office.com/e/CAqS5x7TJT). Topics from all rounds of disciplines are welcomed. (Yes, you are right, we are not confined to maths!)

> We are featuring the following sub-series in our seminar:
> 
> - Week 5: five mini talks (each of 15-30 minutes)
> - Week 8: 8 ⟂ ∞, featuring topics that are as irrelevant as what *Pedro is studying* (aka pure mathematics) as possible!

When giving a talk, you are *highly recommended* (if not mandated by the First Pedro) to follow [the guide of giving a talk](/Pedro/giving_a_talk).
