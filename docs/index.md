# Welcome to PedroSoc
By the grace of *the* Pedro, the PedroSoc is set up as a series of student-led talks that aim to showcase mathematics and computer science that lies outside a typical undergraduate course. Details of regular meetings are as followed.

- Date: every Monday
- Time: from 7pm, until *we forget how to multiply*.
- Venue: High Street Lecture Theatre, University College. (To be confirmed!)

The talks aim to be accessible to first and second year undergraduates, but can touch on more advanced ideas, especially for talks held later in the year. We welcome undergraduates from any College to attend! If you are outside of the University College, [please contact any one of the committees below](#committee)!
