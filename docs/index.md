PedroSoc is one of the two student seminars at the [University College of Oxford](https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk) (Univ). It is tailor-made for undergraduates with a STEM focus, although we welcome talks on humanities and social sciences as well! The society is named after Pedro Lack, the founder (founding *Pedro*) of this seminar series.

Details of regular meetings are as followed.

- Date: every Monday
- Time: from 7.30pm, until *we forget how to multiply*.
- Venue: 90 High Street Lecture Theatre, University College. (*Pending*)

The PedroSoc is mainly for Univ. If you wish to join our community (aka our WhatsApp chat), [please contact any one of the committees below](#committee)!
