**[Check out our appearance at the Oxford Students.](https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2025/05/02/pedrosoc-embracing-erudition/) Thanks Yuhan Wang for writing this article.**

By the grace of *the* Pedro, the PedroSoc is set up as a series of student-led talks that aim to showcase mathematics and computer science that lies outside a typical undergraduate course. Details of regular meetings are as followed.

- Date: every Monday
- Time: from 7.30pm, until *we forget how to multiply*.
- Venue: 
    - Week 3 and 4: 90 High Street Lecture Theatre, University College.
    - Week 5 to 8: *pending* (due to examinations).

The talks aim to be accessible to first and second year undergraduates, but can touch on more advanced ideas, especially for talks held later in the year. The PedroSoc is mainly for members of the [University College, Oxford](https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk). If you wish to join our community (aka our WhatsApp chat), [please contact any one of the committees below](#committee)!

### 12/05/2025 (Week 4) - Thermodynamics from the Scratch
