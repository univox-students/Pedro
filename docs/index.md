# Welcome to PedroSoc
By the grace of *the* Pedro, the PedroSoc is set up as a series of student-led talks that aim to showcase mathematics and computer science that lies outside a typical undergraduate course. Details of regular meetings are as followed.

- Date: every Monday
- Time: from 7pm, until *we forget how to multiply*.
- Venue: 90 High Street Lecture Theatre, University College. (To be confirmed!)

The talks aim to be accessible to first and second year undergraduates, but can touch on more advanced ideas, especially for talks held later in the year. The PedroSoc is mainly for members of the [University College, Oxford](https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk). If you wish to join our community (aka our WhatsApp chat), [please contact any one of the committees below](#committee)!

### 04/11/2024 (Week 4) - Law of Iterated Logarithm Part II
*Speaker: Samuel Chun Hei Lam*

With the tools built from the previous talk, we shall now complete the proof of the classical *law of iterated logarithms*. We shall see how the Borel-Cantelli lemma and the Chernoff bound give half of the proof. Then we will do a little bit more heavy-lifting to obtain the second half of the proof (which may also lead to the Central Limit Theorem for free).
