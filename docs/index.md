> **[Check out our appearance at the Oxford Students.](https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2025/05/02/pedrosoc-embracing-erudition/) Thanks Yuhan Wang for writing this article.**

*By the grace of the Pedro*, PedroSoc is set up as the University College seminar on undergraduate-level extra-curricular academic topics from all disciplines!

We meet at the following time and venue:

- Date: every Monday
- Time: from 7.30pm, until *we forget how to multiply*.
- Venue: 90 High Street Lecture Theatre, University College. (*Pending*)

Whilst this is a Univ society, we welcome attendance and contributions from other members and alumni of the Oxford University. If you wish to join our community (aka our WhatsApp chat), [please contact any one of the committees below](#committee)! 

The seminar series is named after Pedro Lack, the founder (founding *Pedro*) of this seminar series. 

## Upcoming Talks (Michaelmas 2025)
You can submit a talk by [filling this form](https://forms.office.com/e/CAqS5x7TJT). Topics from all rounds of disciplines are welcomed. (Yes, you are right, we are not confined to maths!)

> We are featuring the following sub-series in our seminar:
> 
> - Week 5: five mini talks (each of 15-30 minutes)
> - Week 8: 8 ⟂ ∞, featuring topics that are as irrelevant as what *Pedro is studying* (aka pure mathematics) as possible!

When giving a talk, you are *highly recommended* (if not mandated by the First Pedro) to follow [the guide of giving a talk](/Pedro/giving_a_talk).
